\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {S1}{\ignorespaces Observed (vertical dashed lines) and simulated (solid density curves) synchrony of species per capita growth rates at each site from the IBM (top panels) and the IPM (bottom panels). IPM density curves come from 100 random contiguous sections from 2,000 iteration IPM runs, where the length of each randomly selected section is equal to the numnber of observation years for each data set. IBM density curves come from 100 replicate simulations of 75 iterations each. Synchrony values come from simulations where environmental stochasticity and interspecific interactions are present. The IBM was run on a 5 by 5 meter landscape to reduce the effect of demographic stochasticity.}}{11}{figure.1}

Synchrony of species' percent cover for each study area are from simulation experiments with demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity, and interspecific competition present (``All Drivers''), demographic stochasticity removed (``No D.S.''), environmental stochasticity removed (``No E.S.''), interspecific competition removed (``No Comp.''), interspecific competition and demographic stochasticity removed (``No Comp. + No D.S.''), and interspecific competition and environmental stochasticity removed (``No Comp. + No E.S.''). Abbreviations within the bars for the New Mexico site indicate whether the IBM or IPM was used for a particular simulation. Error bars represent the upper and lower 95\% quantiles from model simulations.}}{12}{figure.2}
