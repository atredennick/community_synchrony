### Paper abstract
>Temporal asynchrony among species is an important mechanism through which diversity can stabilize ecosystem functioning, but identifying the mechanisms that determine synchrony remains a challenge.
Here, we refine and test theory showing that synchrony depends on three factors: species responses to environmental variation, interspecific competition, and demographic stochasticity. We then conduct simulation experiments with empirical population models to quantify the relative importance of these factors in five plant communities.
Simulation experiments showed that the average synchrony of per capita growth rates, which can range from 0 (perfect asynchrony) to 1 (perfect synchrony), was higher when environmental variation was present (0.62) rather than absent (0.43).
Removing interspecific competition and demographic stochasticity had small effects on synchrony. In these plant communities, where species interactions and demographic stochasticity have little influence, synchrony reflects the covariance in species responses to the environment.
